# Web Dev Fall 2015: Project 7

#### Project Description:
Building a Phonebook. This project will be graded on the following:
  - Is it fully functioning
  - Mobile ready design (use bootstrap)
  - Is the code properly written/formatted
  - Project folder structure is proper
  - Design follows wireframes
  - Pretty design - get creative with CSS  

*Do not copy and paste code because you won't learn anything.*

#### Submitting Your Work:
Please make sure all of your work is created within the **deliverables folder**.

#### Topics Covered:
Building a front-end focused product with a stubbed API acting as your database layer. Your task is to create the Phonebook app based on the wireframes provided. Use jQuery to make the API calls (ajax). Use bootstrap to scaffold up styling. Use a form for the search field (pass values in the URL).

You will design four key pages:
```
Home Page
Profile Page
Search Results Page
Show All Page
```

Your `api` will have the following endpoint:

`/api/v1/phonebook/data.json`

See the example in `index.html`.

Use what you've learned in the past classes to create the pages spec'd in the wireframes.
